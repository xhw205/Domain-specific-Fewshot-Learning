##  Centerloss and CNloss on FashionMNIST


### Space distribution

For example,  the 2-th category **Pullover** (green color) and  6-th category **Shirt** (pink color).  Centerloss is difficult to form their own cluster fastly and robustly.

### Test on FashionMNIST

Performance in general classification tasks.

```
python3 test_loss.py
```

| Accuracy | Softmax loss | Center loss | CN loss       |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| （%）    | 89.5± 0.2    | 90.0±0.2    | **91.42±0.3** |

The three use a unified network and parameter settings.

## CUB-200-2011

### Usage

#### Prepare dataset

+ Download [CUB_200_2011 Dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011/CUB_200_2011.tgz).  Unzip and locate it in this directory.

  /home/***/datasets/CUB_200_2011/

+ If you want the focus-areas generated by us. Download [CUB_Attention_Area](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qLB51i3uU9rPxSbRDZmtuIRXr4k5NHW6/view). 

  /home/***/datasets/CUB_Attention/

+ If you want the focus-areas generated by yourself. ( Grad-cam and crop-resize operation are about 9 images per second. )

  + Please re-training model.

  + Run 

    ```
    python3 generate_cub_focus.py
    ```


#### Testing

Default testing, only  on novel classes and without focus-areas. 

```
cd CUB
python3 test_cub.py 
```

You can change the switch of **"withAtt", "novelonly","SUPPORT_NUM"**  of test_cub.py.

#### Re-training

```
python3 train_cub.py
```

## miniPPlankton

#### Dataset

+ Download [miniPPlankton](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wfQdY72RVmExiZapDO8tz4dKMlEm8Ow/view?usp=sharing). Unzip and locate it in this directory.

  /home/***/datasets/phytoplankton/fewshot/

  |   SmallTrain

  |  SmallTest

+ Download [miniPPlanktonFocusAreas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WIi6MoExJwwZ17wgbP5PXndLfDcDeEi/view).Unzip and locate it in this directory. (You can also generate them during the training and testing process.)

  |   SmallTrainAtt

  |  SmallTestAtt

#### Testing

```
python3 test_plank.py
```

The experimental results here use a pre-trained ( ImageNet ) model.

| Acc(%)  | 5way-1shot | 5way-5shot | 10way-1shot | 10way-5shot |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Imprint | 81.55      | 93.27      | 71.93       | 89.65       |
| +CNloss | 83.24      | 93.79      | 73.76       | 90.31       |
| +Att    | **83.35**  | **94.10**  | **73.9**    | **90.45**   |

The model may have reached the data bottleneck, using "Att"  only brings a slight boost.

+ The center point dimension of  loss functions can be set by itself.

We look forward to new breakthroughs for scholars in the future.
